%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any inserted blank page when
%% \cleardoublepage occurs, use one of \clearemptydoublepage or
%% \clearplaindoublepage instead.
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal margins,
%% one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).  For a rough copy
%% (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced, with the word "DRAFT"
%% printed at each corner of every page), use the `draft' option.  The
%% default global line spacing can be changed with one of the following
%% options: `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.  The
%% notes are always single-spaced by default, but can be made to have
%% the same spacing as the rest of the document by using the option
%% `regularspacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be changed with
%% one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4"
%% others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others), `widemargins' (1
%% 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any other standard
%% option for the `report' document class can be used to override the
%% default or draft settings (such as `10pt', `11pt', `12pt'), and
%% standard LaTeX packages can be used to further customize the layout
%% and/or formatting of the document.

%% *** Add any desired options. ***
\documentclass{ut-thesis}

%% *** Add \usepackage declarations here. ***
%% Note that the standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already
%% loaded by `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the
%% functionality they provide.

%% *** NOTE ***
%% Put here all other formatting commands that belong in the preamble.
%% In particular, you should put all of your `\newcommand',
%% `\newenvironment', and `\newtheorem's (in other words, all the global
%% definitions that you will need throughout your thesis) in a separate
%% file and use "\input{filename}" to input it here.


%% List only down to subsections in the table of contents;
%% 0=chapter, 1=section, 2=subsection, 3=subsubsection, etc.
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}

%% Make each page fill up the entire page.

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.  (This can be used anywhere to guarantee that the
%% next page appears on a right-hand page.)
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***
%% (At most 150 words for M.Sc. or 350 words for Ph.D.)
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{dedication}
%% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% you should put an explicit \newpage between them.

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{acknowledgements}
%% *** Put your Acknowledgements here. ***
%\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files      %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the    %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'         %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page, and   %%
%%  allows you to format only parts of your thesis at a time by       %%
%%  using `\includeonly'.                                             %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% *** Include chapter files here. ***


%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% *** Set the bibliography style. ***
%% (change according to your preference)
\bibliographystyle{plain}
%% *** Set the bibliography file. ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change if needed)
\bibliography{thesis}

%% *** NOTE ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file and
%% `\include' or `\input' it here).
